    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the documentation for the Package Explorer page. This document will guide you through the various features and
        functionalities available on this page.
    </p>

    <!-- <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>To begin using the Layers page, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
            consequat.</li>
    </ol> -->

    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>In this section, you can configure various settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimum Recursive Layer File Size: This means that if you were to take all of the packages in any given
            generated layer and calculat the summation of
            their file sizes and the file sizes of their recursive references, it will be no less than the value
            specified here. You would increase this value if you
            want to reduce the number of layers being generated (which increases the efficiency of the build).</li>
        <li>Maximum Recursive Layer File Size: This means that if you were to take all of the packages in any given
            generated layer and calculat the summation of
            their file sizes and the file sizes of their recursive references, it will be no greater than the value
            specified here. You would increase this value if you
            want to reduce the number of layers being generated by allowing a given layer to introduce more new data to
            the container (which increases the efficiency of the build but can mean
            but also means that more of a given container will have to be rebuilt if a package changes).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Package List Usage</h3>
    <p>Here's how you can generate a <b>Package List</b> on the Package Explorer page:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Choose whether you want to display the top or botton N packages by <em>entropy</em>, <em>dependency weight</em>, <em>file size</em> or <em>reverse dependency weight</em>. Where N is the specified value of packages to be displayed.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Use the <span class="btn btn-primary">Add</span> button and <span class="btn btn-danger">Remove</span> button
        to specify any contraints for the packages to do with <em>entropy</em>, <em>dependency weight</em>, <em>file size</em> and <em>reverse dependency weight.</em>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3: Choose by which of the metrics the top / bottom N values should be sorted by, and which project the packages should be from.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Press the <span class="btn btn-success">Generate Package List</span> button.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Click on a package to see more information about it such as its <em>Dependency Weight</em> or to explore it's dependency tree.</em>
    </ol>

    <h3>Store Path Comparison Usage</h3>
    <p>Here's how you can use the <b>Store Path Comparison Tool</b> on the Package Explorer page:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Ensure that you have already generated a package list (please refer to the <b>Package List Usage</b> section of the documentation).</li>
        <li>Step 2: Click on a package to add either one of its store paths or one of the store paths of one of its recursive dependencies as either the base or the comparsion branch in the tool. Note that you can
            explore the dependency tree of a different store path of a package by first clicking on the store path, second selecting a different one and finally pressing 
            the <span class="btn btn-secondary">Go</span> button.
        </li>
        <li>Step 3: Once you have both a base branch and a comparison branch, you can compare the branches by pressing the <span class="btn btn-success">Compare Branches</span> button.</li>
        <li style="display: inline;">Step 4: View the intersection (<p style="color: green; display: inline;">green text</p>) and the disjunction (<p style="color: red; display: inline;">red text</p>)
            of the two branches recursive dependencies.</li>
    </ol>
