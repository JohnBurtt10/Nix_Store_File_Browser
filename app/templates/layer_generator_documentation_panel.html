    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the documentation for the Layers page. This document will guide you through the various features and
        functionalities available on this page.
        The purpose of this tool is to optimize the nix containers to improve the performance, efficiency, and
        maintainability of Nix expressions and derivations
        in the Nix package manager.
    </p>

    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>In this section, you can configure various settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimum Recursive Layer File Size: This means that if you were to take all of the packages in any given
            generated layer and calculat the summation of
            their file sizes and the file sizes of their recursive references, it will be no less than the value
            specified here. You would increase this value if you
            want to reduce the number of layers being generated (which increases the efficiency of the build).</li>
        <li>Maximum Recursive Layer File Size: This means that if you were to take all of the packages in any given
            generated layer and calculat the summation of
            their file sizes and the file sizes of their recursive references, it will be no greater than the value
            specified here. You would increase this value if you
            want to reduce the number of layers being generated by allowing a given layer to introduce more new data to
            the container (which increases the efficiency of the build but can mean
            but also means that more of a given container will have to be rebuilt if a package changes).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Here's how you can use the Layers page:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Specify a period over which to calculate entropy via the <b>Start Date</b> and <b>End Date</b> fields.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Specify a minimum and maximum recursive layer file size.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Press the <span class="btn btn-success">Generate Layers</span> button and optionally preview the layers being generated by
            pressing the <span class="btn btn-primary">Open Package Lists</span> button or cancel
            the operation by pressing the <span class="btn btn-danger">Cancel</span> button.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Once each of the containers reach the specified coverage threshold, view the completed lists of
            layers at the given endpoint (/display/{timestamp}).</li>
    </ol>
