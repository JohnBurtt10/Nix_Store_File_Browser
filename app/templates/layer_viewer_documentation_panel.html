    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the documentation for the Layer Viewer page. This document will guide you through the various features
        and
        functionalities available on this page.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>To begin using the Layers page, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a Container: Choose which container you want to view the layers for.</li>
        <li>Understanding the Information: <em>Layer x-y</em> means that the ordering of the x-th through y-th layers is
            interchangable.
            The <em>Packages</em> field lists the packages explicitiy included in the layer. The <em>New Data</em> field
            of layer N gives the file size in megabytes
            that is included with layer N, but is not with layers 0 through N-1. The <em>Package File Size</em> field
            gives the
            combined file size of the packages
            explicitiy included in the layer. The <em>Total Recursive File Size</em> field gives the combined file size
            of the packages explicitiy included in the layer,
            and the packages that they recursively refernece. The <em>Recursively Accounted For Packages</em> field of
            Layer N lists the packages included with layer N, but not with layers 0 through N-1.</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>In this section, you can configure various settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimum Recursive Layer File Size: This means that if you were to take all of the packages in any given
            generated layer and calculat the summation of
            their file sizes and the file sizes of their recursive references, it will be no less than the value
            specified here. You would increase this value if you
            want to reduce the number of layers being generated (which increases the efficiency of the build).</li>
        <li>Maximum Recursive Layer File Size: This means that if you were to take all of the packages in any given
            generated layer and calculat the summation of
            their file sizes and the file sizes of their recursive references, it will be no greater than the value
            specified here. You would increase this value if you
            want to reduce the number of layers being generated by allowing a given layer to introduce more new data to
            the container (which increases the efficiency of the build but can mean
            but also means that more of a given container will have to be rebuilt if a package changes).</li>
    </ul> -->

    <!-- <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Here's how you can use the Layers page:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Specify a minimum and maximum recursive layer file size.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Press the <span class="btn btn-success">Generate Layers</span> button and optionally preview the layers being generated by
            pressing the <span class="btn btn-primary">Open Package Lists</span> button or cancel
            the operation by pressing the <span class="btn btn-danger">Cancel</span> button.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Once each of the containers reach the specified coverage threshold, view the completed lists of
            layers at the given endpoint (/display/{timestamp}).</li>
    </ol> -->
